# Trapped-Knight
A simulation of the “Trapped Knight” problem on an infinite spiral-numbered chessboard. A knight follows a greedy rule—always jumping to the smallest unvisited square until it becomes trapped. A fun mix of math, algorithms, and visualization inspired by Numberphile.

This site animates the knight’s greedy path step by step on an infinite spiral-numbered chessboard, showing movement, coloring, board, and the final trapped state.
